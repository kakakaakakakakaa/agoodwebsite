        <h1>Welcome to the Crystal DevTeam website!</h1>
        <a href="Incremental.html">Incremental</a>: A simple incremental game made in HTML and JS <br>
        <a href="BLB.html">BitchLasagnaBoard</a>: A simple website to take notes made in HTML and JS<br><br>
        I have to add a copyright mark in here, since a bitch that joined the team fucking destroyed this website (I had a backup luckily) and left the Discord server, unfriended/blocked me and forked this website's GitHub repository and the GitHub repository of my custom shell, Crystal.(He can't really do anything bad with it, actually he made three branches that are exactly the same and he also doesn't have the main file on his Crystal fork. lol.)<br>
        Please send him a DM saying: Why did you destroy Crystal DevTeam's website you fucking jerk? His discord is anomaly@4833<br>
        Dont think I'm imature because of this, he deleted <b>DAYS</b> of hard work I could have lost <b>FOREVER</b> if I didn't had a backup, so he should get what he deserves.<br><br>
